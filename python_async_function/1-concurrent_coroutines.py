''' Description: Import wait_random from the previous python file that
                 youâ€™ve written and write an async routine called wait_n
                 that takes in 2 int arguments: max_delay and n. You will
                 spawn wait_random n times with the specified max_delay.

                 wait_n should return the list of all the delays(float values)
                 The list of the delays should be in ascending order without
                 using sort() because of concurrency.
    Arguments: n: int, max_delay: int = 10
